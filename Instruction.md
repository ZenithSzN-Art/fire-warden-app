You have been asked to produce a cloud-based web application for the University of Winchester, which records the registered location of their fire wardens on campus. The web-application should be hosted using Microsoft Azure and is intended to be accessed via PCs and laptops.

Currently, the University has approximately 70 staff who voluntarily carry-out fire warden duties alongside their contractual duties. A fire warden is responsible for assisting in the ongoing management of fire safety and ensuring the safety of people during a fire evacuation. Due to the University having many buildings across three campuses and an established remote working policy, identifying the location of fire wardens each day is challenging. This makes it difficult to understand their availability should an evacuation be required.

 

## A list of required functionalities is set out below:

The application should allow fire wardens to log their working location at the beginning of each day and make amendments during the day if required. Further to this, the following functionality is required:

- Record the first warden’s unique staff number
- Record the fire warden’s first and surname
- Record the fire warden’s working location*
- Record the date and time of the entry
- Amend recorded details
- Delete recorded details
- Provide a dashboard for the Health and Safety team to view the recorded locations of all fire warden staff

At this stage, the University views your cloud-based web application as a prototype. Implementation with the University mobile application, or deployment as a standalone mobile application, may occur at a later date.

*A list of locations/buildings has been provided later in this brief, for this purpose

 

## Programming Requirements

Although to end-users, your cloud-based web application will appear as a website, you will need to develop a full-stack implementation. This approach will allow certain aspects of the implementation to be reused for the future creation of a mobile version or mobile application. For this, you should use a combination of:

HTML, CSS
Javascript
Node.JS
Express.JS
React.JS
A Microsoft Azure database solution
